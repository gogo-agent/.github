# SCXML Package W3C Specification Compliance Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design for making the SCXML package fully compliant with the W3C SCXML specification (Version 1 September 2015) while leveraging the custom xmldom package for XML processing. The SCXML (State Chart XML) implementation provides a complete state machine engine that adheres to the W3C recommendation for control abstraction.

The implementation is structured around the core W3C SCXML algorithm while utilizing existing infrastructure components like xmldom for XML processing, muid for unique identifiers, and registry for component management.

## Architecture

The SCXML implementation follows a modular architecture with the following core components:

```

### Core Components

1. **Interpreter**: Main execution engine implementing the W3C SCXML algorithm (to be fully implemented)
2. **XML DOM Parser**: Uses xmldom package for parsing SCXML documents (utilizing existing xmldom package)
3. **Data Model**: Supports multiple data models (null, ECMAScript) per W3C spec (partially implemented)
4. **Event System**: MUID-based event identification with priority queuing (implemented in `scxml/event/`)
5. **IoProcessor Manager**: Handles external communication (HTTP, WebSocket, etc.) (implemented in `scxml/ioprocessor/`)
6. **Clock Abstraction**: Time management for deterministic testing (implemented in `scxml/clock/`)

## XML Processing with xmldom

The SCXML implementation utilizes the custom xmldom package for all XML processing needs, ensuring compliance with DOM specifications where applicable to SCXML. The xmldom package provides a complete implementation of the DOM interfaces needed for SCXML processing.

### Key xmldom Features Used

- **Document Interface**: For parsing and manipulating SCXML documents
- **Element Interface**: For accessing SCXML elements and attributes
- **Node Interface**: For traversing the SCXML document tree
- **NamedNodeMap**: For managing element attributes
- **NodeList**: For handling collections of elements

### XML Processing Flow

```

    participant Parser
    participant xmldom

    Parser->>xmldom: Parse SCXML document
    xmldom-->>Parser: Return DOM Document
    Parser->>Interpreter: Extract state machine definition
    Interpreter->>xmldom: Query elements/attributes
    xmldom-->>Interpreter: Return node data
```

The xmldom package provides all necessary DOM interfaces required by the SCXML specification, including Document, Element, Node, and related interfaces. This allows for standards-compliant parsing and manipulation of SCXML documents.

### Data Model Compliance

The implementation supports multiple data models as specified in the W3C specification:

1. **Null Data Model**: Minimal implementation for simple state machines (already implemented in `scxml/datamodel/null.go`)
2. **ECMAScript Data Model**: Full ECMAScript support for complex expressions (partially implemented in `scxml/datamodel/ecmascript.go`)
3. **XPath Data Model**: XPath-based data manipulation (planned for future implementation)

The data model package follows the W3C SCXML specification with interfaces for:

- Expression evaluation
- Conditional expression evaluation
- Script execution
- Variable assignment and retrieval
- System variable management

### Event System Compliance

The event system implements the W3C SCXML event processing model:

1. **External Events**: From IoProcessors (implemented in `scxml/event/`)
2. **Internal Events**: Generated by the state machine (implemented in `scxml/event/`)
3. **Platform Events**: System-generated events (errors, etc.) (implemented in `scxml/event/`)
4. **Event Prioritization**: Internal > Platform > External (implemented via `EventPriority` enum)
5. **Event Queuing**: Proper ordering and processing (implemented via priority queues)

Events are uniquely identified using MUID (Monotonically Unique IDs) for guaranteed uniqueness and traceability across distributed systems.

### IoProcessor Compliance

IoProcessors handle external communication as per the W3C specification:

1. **SCXML IoProcessor**: Internal session communication (implemented in `scxml/ioprocessor/scxml.go`)
2. **HTTP IoProcessor**: HTTP-based event exchange (implemented in `scxml/ioprocessor/http.go`)
3. **WebSocket IoProcessor**: Real-time bidirectional communication (implemented in `scxml/ioprocessor/websocket.go`)
4. **Internal IoProcessor**: Internal event processing (implemented in `scxml/ioprocessor/internal.go`)

IoProcessors are managed through a registry system that allows for dynamic registration and retrieval of processor implementations. Each IoProcessor implements the interface defined in `scxml/ioprocessor/interface.go`.

## Implementation Details

### State Machine Execution Algorithm

The interpreter will implement the exact algorithm specified in the W3C recommendation:

1. **Macrostep Execution**:

   - Select transitions based on events
   - Remove conflicting transitions
   - Execute microsteps for selected transitions

2. **Microstep Execution**:

   - Exit states in exit set
   - Execute transition content
   - Enter states in entry set

3. **Run-to-Completion**: Each external event triggers exactly one macrostep

The algorithm will be implemented following the formal specification in the W3C recommendation, with proper handling of:
- Transition selection and conflict resolution
- Entry and exit procedures
- Data model operations
- Event processing

### Concurrency Model

The implementation will support the `<parallel>` element for concurrent state execution while maintaining deterministic behavior through document order priorities.

### Error Handling

Proper error handling will be implemented according to the W3C error event specification:

- Error events generation
- Error event processing
- Graceful degradation

## Integration Points

### xmldom Integration

The SCXML parser will use xmldom interfaces for all XML operations:

```go
// Example of xmldom usage in SCXML parsing
doc := xmldom.Parse(scxmlContent)
scxmlElement := doc.DocumentElement()
stateElements := scxmlElement.GetElementsByTagName("state")
```

### MUID Integration

All events and sessions will use MUID for unique identification:

```go
// Event ID generation
event := events.NewExternalEvent("user.click")
// event.ID is a MUID string
```

### Registry Integration

IoProcessors and Data Models will be registered using the registry package:

```go
// Registering an IoProcessor
ioprocessor.Register("http", httpIoProcessorFactory)
```

### Clock Abstraction

The clock abstraction provides time-related operations that can be mocked for testing, following the implementation in `scxml/clock/`:

1. **Real Clock**: Provides actual system time for production use
2. **Mock Clock**: Allows for deterministic testing by controlling time progression
3. **Simulation Clock**: Enables fast-forwarding through time for simulation purposes

The clock interface supports all necessary time operations required by the SCXML specification, including timers, tickers, and sleep functions.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Component-level testing using Go testing framework
2. **Conformance Tests**: W3C SCXML test suite implementation
3. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end state machine execution tests
4. **Performance Tests**: Benchmarking state machine execution
5. **Deterministic Testing**: Using clock simulation for reproducible tests

## Security Considerations

1. **XML Processing**: Protection against XML-based attacks (XXE, etc.)
2. **Script Execution**: Sandboxed script execution for data models
3. **Event Validation**: Proper validation of incoming events
4. **Resource Limits**: Protection against resource exhaustion

## Performance Considerations

1. **Memory Management**: Efficient DOM node handling
2. **Event Processing**: Optimized event queue implementation
3. **Transition Selection**: Fast transition matching algorithms
4. **Concurrency**: Efficient parallel state handling

## Future Extensions

1. **Additional Data Models**: Support for XPath and other data models
2. **Advanced IoProcessors**: More communication protocols
3. **Visualization**: State machine visualization tools
4. **Monitoring**: Observability and tracing integration
